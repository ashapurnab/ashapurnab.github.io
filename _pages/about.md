I am a PhD scholar at Queen Mary University of London, holding a fully funded position as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). My research focuses on exploring the intersection of religious freedom and individual liberty, with a particular emphasis on the judiciary's role in preserving a harmonious equilibrium between these two fundamental principles.
